A website that can be used to help students learn how to program, by offering a different tab for multiple languages
in which the user can enter what they want to happen in english, and then the website returns back to them the code
requested, as well as an explination on the parts of the code. This will be achieved by using OPENAI API key prompting,
using python for the backend and CSS/JS for frontend. Make sure to give lots of comments as well within the code
to help understand what is going on.
